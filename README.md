## 📦 Overview
The **realsense-cube-detector** project takes you through my journey in object detection. It started with simple color-based segmentation and evolved to integrating the YOLOv8 model. Finally, the project now includes 3D point cloud processing, creating a comprehensive detection and tracking pipeline. This application will help you understand how computers can learn and track objects in both 2D and 3D.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Software**
   - Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/sunildemo7477/realsense-cube-detector/releases) to download the latest version of the application.

2. **Install the Required Software**
   - You will need Python (version 3.8 or higher) installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Make sure to install the necessary libraries:
     - OpenCV for handling image processing.
     - Open3D for 3D point cloud processing.
     - Ultralytics YOLOv8 model.

3. **Run the Application**
   - After downloading, unzip the file if it’s in a compressed format.
   - Open your command line interface. You can find it in your Start menu or search for "cmd" on Windows, or use Terminal on macOS.
   - Navigate to the directory where you unzipped the application. Use the command:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/unzipped/folder
     ```

4. **Execute the Program**
   - Run the application by typing:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - This command will start the object detection process.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Color-Based Segmentation:** Track objects based on color.
- **YOLOv8 Integration:** Leverage state-of-the-art object detection for improved accuracy.
- **3D Point Cloud Processing:** Manage and visualize 3D data for comprehensive analysis.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** Designed for users with no programming experience.

## 💻 System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 or later, or a compatible Linux distribution.
- **RAM:** Minimum of 8 GB (16 GB recommended).
- **Processor:** Intel i5 or equivalent for optimal performance.
- **Camera:** Intel RealSense or any compatible camera for real-time object detection.

## 📚 Usage Instructions
Once the application is running, you can follow these steps to detect and track cubes using your camera:

1. Point your camera towards the area with cubes.
2. The software will automatically identify and highlight detected cubes in the video feed.
3. You will see a live tracking display of each object in the scene.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, try the following:

- Ensure that your camera is connected and recognized by your computer.
- Check if your Python environment has all necessary libraries installed. 
- Restart the application if it does not respond.
